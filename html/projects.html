                                    In the summer of 2019, I was hired as a software intern for Itiviti India Private Limited, where I worked on two projects. 
                                    The organization develops software products to help financial institutions worldwide
                                    with their trading practices. In an era where the capital markets are highly complex, 
                                    automated trading operation is a highly complex business, where the lack of testing strategies 
                                    has a huge impact. Managing test environments, with multiple test components, is costly 
                                    and resource-intensive both in terms of staffing and technical infrastructure requirements. 
                                    Firms may end up spending more time maintaining their complex testing 
                                    environments than performing actual tests. VeriFIX Enterprise is a software application 
                                    developed by Itviti which helps firms manage their testing environments. This project aimed 
                                    at automating the test cases for the software application, VeriFIX Enterprise.

                                    As the application of VeriFIX enterprise is constantly developing, upgrading and adding 
                                    new features to it, proof testing of the upgrades and newer additions are necessary to find 
                                    out the bugs and their removal. To test any software, manual testing is performed on 
                                    the newly upgraded components, which is followed by automated testing of the complete software. 
                                    For certain components, the manual testing part had been completed, and the test cases needed 
                                    to be automated to fasten the process of testing in further deployments. The task assigned to 
                                    me was to validate the working of a filter criteria button in the web application
                                    and generate test cases for the same.

                                    To test the filter criteria button, the first step was logging in to the web application. To 
                                    automate this step, the Selenium web driver was used to log in and perform all the 
                                    navigational tasks that had to be performed before the actual test started. The code for 
                                    performing all these tasks was kept in the proper annotation of the JUnit Test Case so that 
                                    these tasks would run at the beginning. Before applying the filter, all the messages were extracted 
                                    and those which had the desired filter present in them were counted. The count was stored. The next step was to apply 
                                    the filter and count the total number of messages present. If this number matched with the number 
                                    stored, this part of the test would be a success, else it would fail and indicate that 
                                    the filter criteria button wasn't working properly. An additional condition was added to further 
                                    validate the button, which was to check if every message in the message box after application of 
                                    filter criteria contained the desired filter or not. The first condition ensured that no messages were 
                                    missed out after the application of the filter, while the second condition ensured that no messages that 
                                    shouldn't be present appeared in the message box. If both the conditions passed successfully, the test passed,
                                    indicating that the filter criteria button was working properly. If any of the above conditions failed, the test 
                                    would fail and indicate some error in the working of the filter criteria button.

                                    In the summer of 2019, I worked as a software intern for Itiviti India Private Limited, 
                                    where I worked on two projects. The organization develops software products to help financial 
                                    institutions worldwide with their trading practices. One of their products was the Itiviti 
                                    Analyst package. It is a package consisting of a suite of apps, sessions, disks as well as 
                                    databases which ensures that the various trading practices followed by its various clients 
                                    comply with various trade regulations. Morning checks are a series of checks being done daily 
                                    to ensure the proper implementation of the Itiviti Analyst package. This project aimed at automating 
                                    the manual process of morning checks.

                                    The Itiviti Analyst package is implemented on the client-side of the server. Post-implementation, 
                                    the team ensures that all the apps run correctly, checks whether all the sessions 
                                    are appropriately configured and verifies if the data collection is happening correctly. 
                                    To ensure this, a series of checks were done daily, which are known as morning checks. 
                                    The entire process of morning checks consists of 10 components, which were performed one after the 
                                    other. This was followed by the preparation of a report that contained the results and summary of 
                                    the checks. This report was sent to the client via email. This process of performing the checks 
                                    and preparing the reports was being carried out manually for every client. Only the process of 
                                    sending email had already been automated. The entire process, from performing the check to 
                                    sending the email used to take around 1 to 1.5 hours per client. The task assigned to me was 
                                    to automate the processes of performing the checks and preparing the reports so that it could be 
                                    seamlessly integrated with the existing script which sent the email.

                                    For performing the checks, the tester had to login into the client-side of the server through a remote 
                                    access connection. The server was a Linux server and the software PuTTY was used for this purpose. 
                                    After having remote access to the server, the tester had to login into the database containing 
                                    the details of all the package components configured for the client. The status of all the components 
                                    can be known from the database. Then, corresponding to each of the 10 components of the morning checks, 
                                    a series of commands were fired from the terminal. The output from every command was collected manually
                                    and stored. 
                                    These outputs were combined and accordingly processed to generate the result of the particular component. 
                                    The results were integrated into a file to prepare the report.

                                    The basic idea behind the automation of morning checks was to replicate the process being carried 
                                    out manually. Since the manual process included the firing of commands into the Linux terminal, a 
                                    library had to be chosen which could fire commands into the terminal from the script itself and 
                                    collect the output. Various Python libraries are available which allow the user to interact with 
                                    the command line. Some notable ones among them are Python Fire, subprocess, threading, multithreading 
                                    and multiprocessing libraries. For choosing the appropriate library, the following points had to be considered:
                                    <ul class="project-learnings" id="project-content-bottom">
                                        <li>The library must allow the creation and running of a new process from the script itself</li>
                                        <li>The library must check the output of the process i.e., whether the command successfully ran or not</li>
                                        <li>The library must be able to collect the output of the command displayed on the terminal and save it in a file</li>
                                        <li>The library must be present in Python 2.7, which was the version of Python being used on the server at that time</li>

                                    After a suitable library was chosen, the next task was to write a script to automate each component 
                                    of the morning checks. For every component, one or more commands were fired into the terminal using 
                                    the subprocess library. Depending upon the commands and the requirements, either the output of the 
                                    process (whether the process ran successfully or not) or the output displayed by the command on the 
                                    terminal was collected. This output was stored in a text file and the required processing related 
                                    to the component of the check was performed.

                                    The report of morning checks was prepared in two formats. One was a regular .txt file and the other one 
                                    was a .html file. At the beginning of the script, an empty .txt/.html file was created. After processing 
                                    the outputs from the terminal, the results were appended to the .txt file. In the case of the .html file, 
                                    appropriate tags were inserted at appropriate locations to ensure the proper formatting of the report.

                                <p class="project-description-content">
                                    The biggest issue during the automation of morning checks was the handling of exceptions. The entire process 
                                    of morning checks was being carried out on a real-time operating server. The server being dynamic was bound 
                                    to cause misfunctioning of commands at certain times. All the commands in the script 
                                    were being fired in series. Hence, the termination or misfunctioning of a single command would lead to the 
                                    termination of the entire script. To avoid this, exception handling was needed. This was achieved 
                                    by carefully examining the piece of code for possible sources where termination of the script could take place. 
                                    To handle these exceptions, a try-except block was used for every possible case. The except block was 
                                    carefully designed to ensure that the script doesn't terminate due to the non-functioning of commands.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="project-content-header">Ensuring robustness of the created script</h5>
                                <p class="project-description-content">
                                    The most important part of the project was to ensure the robustness of the script. This was done to ensure 
                                    that the same script could be used for different clients by making minimal changes to it. The different variables for a client were stored in different lists, each 
                                    corresponding to a different command, at the top of the script. While execution, the script would take values from the 
                                    list, insert them at the appropriate position in the command and then fire it. Hence, the process of modifying the script 
                                    for different clients reduced down to suitably manipulating the different lists for a particular client. The script was 
                                    designed to take care of the rest.

                                    <li>Created another Python script that performs the morning checks and generates the reports in .html format. This report could be 
                                        easily integrated with another existing Python script which would send it directly to the client via an email. 
                                        Thus, firing a single command to run the script would perform all the morning checks, generate the report and 
                                        send it to the client.</li>
                                    <li>Ensured robustness of the created script, thereby allowing the same script to prepare the reports for multiple clients by fine-tuning it.</li>
                                    <li>Reduced the time taken for preparation of morning checks reports significantly from 1 hour to a worst-case of less than 2 minutes per client. 
                                        The worst-case time was due to the presence of such commands which on receiving no output for the terminal would continue to run for 30 seconds. 
                                        On an average case, the script was competent enough to prepare the reports in less than 30 seconds.</li>
                                    <li>Ensured that the created reports do not eat up the memory by suitably deleting old reports after a few days. The number of days for which 
                                        the report has to be kept can be specified by the user. On execution, the script would check for old morning checks reports, delete them and then 
                                        perform the checks.</li>

                                    During my bachelor's project in 2019-20, I worked with a team of researchers from Energy and Process 
                                    Engineering Laboratory, IIT Kharagpur. The team of researchers were working on various types of 
                                    industrial distillation processes and working on ways to make the process more energy-efficient. 
                                    It is a well-established fact that for multicomponent distillation involving <i>n</i> components, 
                                    at least <i>n-1</i> distillation columns are needed to achieve the desired degree of purification. 
                                    Hence, a ternary mixture requires at least two distillation units for its separation. A single 
                                    distillation column itself demands energy in the range of 1-100 MW. Thus, the energy requirement 
                                    for the separation of a ternary mixture itself using distillation is enormous. To add to that, 
                                    95% of liquid separation processes use distillation as their primary method of separation, which 
                                    are mostly conventional distillation units. Hence, the field of distillation presents itself with 
                                    a high potential for possible energy savings. This project aimed at modelling a distillation system 
                                    and obtaining an optimal operating configuration for a conventional distillation sequence involving 
                                    two distillation units in series. The results from this project served as a minimum benchmark with  
                                    which the results from other modifications of distillation units were compared.

                                    The conventional distillation sequence was modelled using the direct sequence in Aspen. Two different but 
                                    non-independent RadFrac columns were employed in Aspen to model the system using the rigorous method of simulation.
                                    The system modelled in Aspen was interfaced with MATLAB using the ActiveX server. MATLAB was used to generate 
                                    all the inputs, which were sent to Aspen via the ActiveX server. The simulations were run and completed in Aspen, 
                                    the results were prepared and MATLAB was notified about the completion of the simulation. The outputs were collected 
                                    from Aspen and then used further.

                                    variables that had a significant influence on any of the objective functions were chosen and the rest were discarded.
                                    The results after simulation were fed as input to the NSGA-II algorithm to run the optimization and generate a pareto-optimal front.

                                    During my bachelor's project in 2019-20, I had worked on a project to optimize the configuration of a 
                                    conventional distillation sequence involving two columns in series. The project on dividing wall columns 
                                    (<i>DWC</i>) is an extension of that project. The dividing wall column is an intensified equipment that 
                                    integrates the two columns of a conventional distillation column into a single shell. Hence, a ternary 
                                    mixture separation is possible through a single column, compared to the conventional distillation sequence 
                                    that requires two columns. Hence, the presence of a single column, reboiler and condenser allow it to 
                                    deliver a large amount of savings in the operating and capital costs. Installing a <i>DWC</i> over two 
                                    conventional units can lead to a huge reduction in the installation space as well. This project aimed at 
                                    evaluating the potential savings if the conventional distillation sequence (<i>CDS</i>) was replaced with 
                                    a dividing wall column.

                                    In the summer of 2019, I was hired as a software intern for Itiviti India Private Limited, where I worked on two projects. 
                                    The organization develops software products to help financial institutions worldwide
                                    with their trading practices. In an era where the capital markets are highly complex, 
                                    automated trading operation is a highly complex business, where the lack of testing strategies 
                                    has a huge impact. Managing test environments, with multiple test components, is costly 
                                    and resource-intensive both in terms of staffing and technical infrastructure requirements. 
                                    Firms may end up spending more time maintaining their complex testing 
                                    environments than performing actual tests. VeriFIX Enterprise is a software application 
                                    developed by Itviti which helps firms manage their testing environments. This project aimed 
                                    at automating the test cases for the software application, VeriFIX Enterprise.

                                    As the application of VeriFIX enterprise is constantly developing, upgrading and adding 
                                    new features to it, proof testing of the upgrades and newer additions are necessary to find 
                                    out the bugs and their removal. To test any software, manual testing is performed on 
                                    the newly upgraded components, which is followed by automated testing of the complete software. 
                                    For certain components, the manual testing part had been completed, and the test cases needed 
                                    to be automated to fasten the process of testing in further deployments. The task assigned to 
                                    me was to validate the working of a filter criteria button in the web application
                                    and generate test cases for the same.

                                    To test the filter criteria button, the first step was logging in to the web application. To 
                                    automate this step, the Selenium web driver was used to log in and perform all the 
                                    navigational tasks that had to be performed before the actual test started. The code for 
                                    performing all these tasks was kept in the proper annotation of the JUnit Test Case so that 
                                    these tasks would run at the beginning. Before applying the filter, all the messages were extracted 
                                    and those which had the desired filter present in them were counted. The count was stored. The next step was to apply 
                                    the filter and count the total number of messages present. If this number matched with the number 
                                    stored, this part of the test would be a success, else it would fail and indicate that 
                                    the filter criteria button wasn't working properly. An additional condition was added to further 
                                    validate the button, which was to check if every message in the message box after application of 
                                    filter criteria contained the desired filter or not. The first condition ensured that no messages were 
                                    missed out after the application of the filter, while the second condition ensured that no messages that 
                                    shouldn't be present appeared in the message box. If both the conditions passed successfully, the test passed,
                                    indicating that the filter criteria button was working properly. If any of the above conditions failed, the test 
                                    would fail and indicate some error in the working of the filter criteria button.

                                    In the summer of 2019, I worked as a software intern for Itiviti India Private Limited, 
                                    where I worked on two projects. The organization develops software products to help financial 
                                    institutions worldwide with their trading practices. One of their products was the Itiviti 
                                    Analyst package. It is a package consisting of a suite of apps, sessions, disks as well as 
                                    databases which ensures that the various trading practices followed by its various clients 
                                    comply with various trade regulations. Morning checks are a series of checks being done daily 
                                    to ensure the proper implementation of the Itiviti Analyst package. This project aimed at automating 
                                    the manual process of morning checks.

                                    The Itiviti Analyst package is implemented on the client-side of the server. Post-implementation, 
                                    the team ensures that all the apps run correctly, checks whether all the sessions 
                                    are appropriately configured and verifies if the data collection is happening correctly. 
                                    To ensure this, a series of checks were done daily, which are known as morning checks. 
                                    The entire process of morning checks consists of 10 components, which were performed one after the 
                                    other. This was followed by the preparation of a report that contained the results and summary of 
                                    the checks. This report was sent to the client via email. This process of performing the checks 
                                    and preparing the reports was being carried out manually for every client. Only the process of 
                                    sending email had already been automated. The entire process, from performing the check to 
                                    sending the email used to take around 1 to 1.5 hours per client. The task assigned to me was 
                                    to automate the processes of performing the checks and preparing the reports so that it could be 
                                    seamlessly integrated with the existing script which sent the email.

                                    For performing the checks, the tester had to login into the client-side of the server through a remote 
                                    access connection. The server was a Linux server and the software PuTTY was used for this purpose. 
                                    After having remote access to the server, the tester had to login into the database containing 
                                    the details of all the package components configured for the client. The status of all the components 
                                    can be known from the database. Then, corresponding to each of the 10 components of the morning checks, 
                                    a series of commands were fired from the terminal. The output from every command was collected manually
                                    and stored. 
                                    These outputs were combined and accordingly processed to generate the result of the particular component. 
                                    The results were integrated into a file to prepare the report.

                                <p class="project-description-content" id="project-content-bottom">
                                    The basic idea behind the automation of morning checks was to replicate the process being carried 
                                    out manually. Since the manual process included the firing of commands into the Linux terminal, a 
                                    library had to be chosen which could fire commands into the terminal from the script itself and 
                                    collect the output. Various Python libraries are available which allow the user to interact with 
                                    the command line. Some notable ones among them are Python Fire, subprocess, threading, multithreading 
                                    and multiprocessing libraries. For choosing the appropriate library, the following points had to be considered:
                                    <ul class="project-learnings" id="project-content-bottom">
                                        <li>The library must allow the creation and running of a new process from the script itself</li>
                                        <li>The library must check the output of the process i.e., whether the command successfully ran or not</li>
                                        <li>The library must be able to collect the output of the command displayed on the terminal and save it in a file</li>
                                        <li>The library must be present in Python 2.7, which was the version of Python being used on the server at that time</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="project-description-content">
                                        Considering these points, the subprocess library was chosen as it satisfied all of them.
                                    </p>

                                <p class="project-description-content">
                                    After a suitable library was chosen, the next task was to write a script to automate each component 
                                    of the morning checks. For every component, one or more commands were fired into the terminal using 
                                    the subprocess library. Depending upon the commands and the requirements, either the output of the 
                                    process (whether the process ran successfully or not) or the output displayed by the command on the 
                                    terminal was collected. This output was stored in a text file and the required processing related 
                                    to the component of the check was performed.
                                </p>

                                    The report of morning checks was prepared in two formats. One was a regular .txt file and the other one 
                                    was a .html file. At the beginning of the script, an empty .txt/.html file was created. After processing 
                                    the outputs from the terminal, the results were appended to the .txt file. In the case of the .html file, 
                                    appropriate tags were inserted at appropriate locations to ensure the proper formatting of the report.

                                <p class="project-description-content">
                                    The biggest issue during the automation of morning checks was the handling of exceptions. The entire process 
                                    of morning checks was being carried out on a real-time operating server. The server being dynamic was bound 
                                    to cause misfunctioning of commands at certain times. All the commands in the script 
                                    were being fired in series. Hence, the termination or misfunctioning of a single command would lead to the 
                                    termination of the entire script. To avoid this, exception handling was needed. This was achieved 
                                    by carefully examining the piece of code for possible sources where termination of the script could take place. 
                                    To handle these exceptions, a try-except block was used for every possible case. The except block was 
                                    carefully designed to ensure that the script doesn't terminate due to the non-functioning of commands.
                                </p>

                                <p class="project-description-content">
                                    The most important part of the project was to ensure the robustness of the script. This was done to ensure 
                                    that the same script could be used for different clients by making minimal changes to it. The different variables for a client were stored in different lists, each 
                                    corresponding to a different command, at the top of the script. While execution, the script would take values from the 
                                    list, insert them at the appropriate position in the command and then fire it. Hence, the process of modifying the script 
                                    for different clients reduced down to suitably manipulating the different lists for a particular client. The script was 
                                    designed to take care of the rest.

                                    <li>Created a Python script that performs all the components of the morning checks and generates the report in .txt format.</li>
                                    <li>Created another Python script that performs the morning checks and generates the reports in .html format. This report could be 
                                        easily integrated with another existing Python script which would send it directly to the client via an email. 
                                        Thus, firing a single command to run the script would perform all the morning checks, generate the report and 
                                        send it to the client.</li>
                                    <li>Ensured robustness of the created script, thereby allowing the same script to prepare the reports for multiple clients by fine-tuning it.</li>
                                    <li>Reduced the time taken for preparation of morning checks reports significantly from 1 hour to a worst-case of less than 2 minutes per client. 
                                        The worst-case time was due to the presence of such commands which on receiving no output for the terminal would continue to run for 30 seconds. 
                                        On an average case, the script was competent enough to prepare the reports in less than 30 seconds.</li>
                                    <li>Ensured that the created reports do not eat up the memory by suitably deleting old reports after a few days. The number of days for which 
                                        the report has to be kept can be specified by the user. On execution, the script would check for old morning checks reports, delete them and then 
                                        perform the checks.</li>

                                    During my bachelor's project in 2019-20, I worked with a team of researchers from Energy and Process 
                                    Engineering Laboratory, IIT Kharagpur. The team of researchers were working on various types of 
                                    industrial distillation processes and working on ways to make the process more energy-efficient. 
                                    It is a well-established fact that for multicomponent distillation involving <i>n</i> components, 
                                    at least <i>n-1</i> distillation columns are needed to achieve the desired degree of purification. 
                                    Hence, a ternary mixture requires at least two distillation units for its separation. A single 
                                    distillation column itself demands energy in the range of 1-100 MW. Thus, the energy requirement 
                                    for the separation of a ternary mixture itself using distillation is enormous. To add to that, 
                                    95% of liquid separation processes use distillation as their primary method of separation, which 
                                    are mostly conventional distillation units. Hence, the field of distillation presents itself with 
                                    a high potential for possible energy savings. This project aimed at modelling a distillation system 
                                    and obtaining an optimal operating configuration for a conventional distillation sequence involving 
                                    two distillation units in series. The results from this project served as a minimum benchmark with  
                                    which the results from other modifications of distillation units were compared.

                                    The conventional distillation sequence was modelled using the direct sequence in Aspen. Two different but 
                                    non-independent RadFrac columns were employed in Aspen to model the system using the rigorous method of simulation.
                                    The system modelled in Aspen was interfaced with MATLAB using the ActiveX server. MATLAB was used to generate 
                                    all the inputs, which were sent to Aspen via the ActiveX server. The simulations were run and completed in Aspen, 
                                    the results were prepared and MATLAB was notified about the completion of the simulation. The outputs were collected 
                                    from Aspen and then used further.

                                    To determine the decision variables which influence the objectives, sensitivity analysis was carried out. 
                                    Different inputs were chosen and their correlation with all the objectives was found. The data points for 
                                    determining the correlation coefficient were also generated through rigorous simulation in Aspen. From this, those 
                                    variables that had a significant influence on any of the objective functions were chosen and the rest were discarded.
                                    The results after simulation were fed as input to the NSGA-II algorithm to run the optimization and generate a pareto-optimal front.

                                    NSGA-II gives a set of optimal solutions, none of which is more dominating than the other. However, the determination of 
                                    one condition out of the many generated remains an issue. Many methods have been suggested to do so. The technique for 
                                    order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (<i>TOPSIS</i>) is one of the most straightforward and most practical 
                                    techniques for the identification of a truly optimal solution from the set of non-dominated solutions and was used to
                                    select one optimal point from the set of solutions.

                                    This project dealt with the multi-objective optimization of a conventional distillation sequence containing two distillation 
                                    units in series. However, various alternatives have been suggested where the process can be carried out in a single column, thus 
                                    leading to significant savings in capital cost, operating cost, as well as space. The steps post this work was to carry out the 
                                    same process for one of the alternatives, the dividing wall column.

                                    During my bachelor's project in 2019-20, I had worked on a project to optimize the configuration of a 
                                    conventional distillation sequence involving two columns in series. The project on dividing wall columns 
                                    (<i>DWC</i>) is an extension of that project. The dividing wall column is an intensified equipment that 
                                    integrates the two columns of a conventional distillation column into a single shell. Hence, a ternary 
                                    mixture separation is possible through a single column, compared to the conventional distillation sequence 
                                    that requires two columns. Hence, the presence of a single column, reboiler and condenser allow it to 
                                    deliver a large amount of savings in the operating and capital costs. Installing a <i>DWC</i> over two 
                                    conventional units can lead to a huge reduction in the installation space as well. This project aimed at 
                                    evaluating the potential savings if the conventional distillation sequence (<i>CDS</i>) was replaced with 
                                    a dividing wall column.
